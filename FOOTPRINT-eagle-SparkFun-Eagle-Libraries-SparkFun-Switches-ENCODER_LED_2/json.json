They output gray code so that you can tell how much and in which direction the encoder has been turned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This encoder has a red/green LED built-in, which shines through the encoder shaft.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/LED/EC12PLRVF-D-24K-24-24C-0206-6H%28SPEC%29.pdf&quot;&gt;Datasheet&lt;/a&gt; (EC12PLGRSDVF-D-25K-24-32/07-6H)&lt;/p&gt;"
