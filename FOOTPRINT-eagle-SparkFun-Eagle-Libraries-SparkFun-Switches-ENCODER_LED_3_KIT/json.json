            "value": "&lt;h3&gt;Illuminated Rotary Encoder w/ RGB LED and select switch&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Encoders rotate similarly to potentiometers, but theyre different from potentiometers in that an encoder has full rotation without limits. They output gray code so that you can tell how much and in which direction the encoder has been turned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This encoder includes an RGB LED and a push-down select switch.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; This is the KIT version of this package. This package has a smaller diameter top stop mask, which doesn't cover the diameter of the pad. This means only the bottom side of the pads' copper will be exposed. You'll only be able to solder to the bottom side.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/Switches/EC12PLRGBSDVBF-D-25K-24-24C-6108-6H.pdf&quot;&gt;Dimensional Drawing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
