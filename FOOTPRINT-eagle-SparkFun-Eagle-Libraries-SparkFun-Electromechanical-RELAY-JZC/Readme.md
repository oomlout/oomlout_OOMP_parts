- description: &lt;h3&gt;Relay SPDT Sealed (JZC-11F-5V-1Z)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are high quality Single Pole - Double Throw (SPDT) sealed relays. Use them to switch high voltage, and/or high current devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This relays coil is rated up to 12V, with a minimum switching voltage of 5V. The contacts are rated up to 5A (@250VAC, 30VDC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/General/JZC-11F-05VDC-1Z%20EN.pdf&quot;&gt;Datasheet&lt;/a&gt; (JZC-11F-5V-1Z)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt;: The datasheet specifies a 5.04mm (.2 inch) gap between pins two and three. This does not reflect the &lt;i&gt;actual&lt;/i&gt; gap between the two pins which is .17 inches. Furthermore the gap is not split into an equidistant Y-offset with pin four. Instead, pin 3 is 2.54mm (.1 inch) in the Y-direction from center of pin four and pin 4 is .07 inches in the negative Y direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Devices Using&lt;/h4&gt;
