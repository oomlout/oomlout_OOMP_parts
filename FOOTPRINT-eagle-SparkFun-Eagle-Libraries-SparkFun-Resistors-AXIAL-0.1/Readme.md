- description: &lt;h3&gt;AXIAL-0.1-KIT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commonly used for 1/4W through-hole resistors. 0.1&quot; pitch between holes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; This is the KIT version of the AXIAL-0.1 package. This package has a smaller diameter top stop mask, which doesn't cover the diameter of the pad. This means only the bottom side of the pads' copper will be exposed. You'll only be able to solder to the bottom side.&lt;/p&gt;
