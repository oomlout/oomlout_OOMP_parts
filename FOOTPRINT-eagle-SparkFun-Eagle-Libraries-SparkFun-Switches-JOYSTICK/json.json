            "value": "&lt;h3&gt;Thumb Joystick&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a joystick very similar to the analog joysticks on PS2 (PlayStation 2) controllers. Directional movements are simply two potentiometers - one for each axis. Pots are ~10k each. This joystick also has a select button that is actuated when the joystick is pressed down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.p3america.com/pp/802.htm&quot;&gt;Datasheet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
