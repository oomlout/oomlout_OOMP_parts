Place along the edge of a panel of PCBs, this will allow for panels with boards not connected by v-scores, which allows for easier depanelization where there are overhanging components. It can also be used for designs too small to accomodate fiducial marks on individual boards.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Devices using:\n&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;FIDUCIALTAB&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;"
